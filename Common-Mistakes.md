## ❌ Formatting & Layout Mistakes

* [ ] ❗ **Inconsistent formatting** across sections (e.g., switching font sizes or bullet styles)
* [ ] ❗ **Overuse of bold/italics/colors**, which distracts from content clarity
* [ ] ❗ **Margins too narrow** or cluttered layout (hurts readability and printing)
* [ ] ❗ **Huge blocks of text** instead of bullet points
* [ ] ❗ **No clear section headers** – reader has to hunt for information

### 🛠 Fix:

> Use 1–2 clean fonts, consistent bullet alignment, 0.6–0.75 inch margins, and clearly marked sections.

## ❌ Content Problems

* [ ] ❗ **Job descriptions too vague** (e.g., "Worked on modeling")
* [ ] ❗ **No clear personal contributions** in collaborative projects
* [ ] ❗ **Redundant or outdated experience** takes up valuable space
* [ ] ❗ **Lack of quantified achievements** (e.g., "Improved performance by 25%")
* [ ] ❗ **Too much focus on coursework** (after Year 2 PhD, skip class lists)
* [ ] ❗ **Including low-impact publications** (e.g., campus magazines, unless relevant)
* [ ] ❗ **Mixing up preprints, under-review, and published work without clarification**
* [ ] ❗ **Overly long CV for early career stage**.
    

### 🛠 Fix:

> Be precise, use impact verbs, include metrics where possible, and prioritize quality over quantity.

## ❌ Language & Tone Issues

* [ ] ❗ **Passive voice** (e.g., "responsible for") instead of action verbs ("led", "created")
* [ ] ❗ **Too humble or apologetic** (e.g., "just assisted", "minor role")
* [ ] ❗ **Overinflated or unverifiable claims** (e.g., "world-class expert")
* [ ] ❗ **First-person pronouns** (e.g., "I conducted...") — CVs are impersonal

### 🛠 Fix:

> Use concise, confident bullet points starting with verbs. Avoid subjective or exaggerated language.

---

## ❌ Technical or PDF Issues

* [ ] ❗ **Missing file metadata** (e.g., no author name in PDF properties)
* [ ] ❗ **Weird file names** (e.g., `final_version_6_real.pdf`)
* [ ] ❗ **Large file sizes** due to embedded images or unnecessary formatting
* [ ] ❗ **Unreadable on mobile or black-and-white print** (check contrast and font size)

### 🛠 Fix:

> Name files cleanly (`Lastname_Firstname_CV_2025.pdf`), compress PDF, and test on different devices.

---

## ❌ Strategy Mistakes

* [ ] ❗ **One-size-fits-all CV** not tailored for fellowship, postdoc, or industry role
* [ ] ❗ **No version control or changelog** (especially if updating frequently)
* [ ] ❗ **No link to online portfolio/GitHub/ORCID**
* [ ] ❗ **Leaving out key differentiators** like leadership, outreach, or teaching

### 🛠 Fix:

> Tailor CVs to each opportunity. Use a master version and create forks for specific submissions. Include a footer or header link to your online presence.

## ✅ Final Advice

> Think like a reviewer. Can they find your contributions in 15 seconds? Can they understand your value even if they’re not in your field?

> Print your CV. Read it aloud. Have a colleague scan it in 60 seconds and tell you what stands out. Then fix what doesn’t.
