## 📌 Core Guidelines

### 🎯 Focus on Impact

* Frame experiences in terms of **results** or **contributions**, not just tasks.
* Use **quantitative outcomes** when possible: e.g., "Increased simulation accuracy by 17%".
* Show what makes each experience **unique and valuable**.

### 🧱 Use Bullet Points, Not Paragraphs

| Section              | Tip                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Publications         | Reverse chronological order; full citation; bold your name.        |
| Research Experience  | Summarize the problem, your contribution, and the outcome.         |
| Teaching & Mentoring | List course titles, number of students, and your responsibilities. |
| Leadership / Service | Mention roles, organizations, and measurable activities.           |

## 🧠 Pro-Tips from Resume Experts

### 💡 Positive Writing = Powerful First Impressions

> Use active, energetic language to persuade the reader that your experiences are significant.

Avoid:

> "Was responsible for running simulations."

Instead:

> "Executed and optimized climate simulations, enabling 30% faster calibration."

### 💥 Use Power Words

| Power Verbs          | Categories       |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Achieved, Delivered  | Accomplishments  |
| Adapted, Improved    | Problem-solving  |
| Created, Developed   | Innovation       |
| Led, Co-ordinated    | Leadership       |
| Trained, Mentored    | Communication    |
| Analysed, Researched | Scientific Rigor |

Sprinkle these across bullet points to add punch and clarity.

## 🧠 Personal Brand = Professional Identity

Your CV should reflect who you are. Define:

* **Talents** — What do you excel at?
* **Values** — What motivates you?
* **USP (Unique Selling Point)** — Why you over other applicants?

You can express these through:

* A profile or summary at the top of your CV.
* Personal statement in fellowship/job applications.
* Bio sections on LinkedIn, GitHub, or personal websites.

> 🎯 Tip: One strong sentence that aligns your academic identity with your career goal is better than a vague paragraph.
